# Python-based Calculator
Personal project started during winter break of 2020-2021

## Why?
I was bored and got inspired by a video on Youtube of a develepor creating a web-based calculator.
**The code is written from scratch with no tutorials**

## Inspiration
As previously mentioned, I was inspired by a video on Youtube; however, that was not my only source of inspiration.
Recently, I discovered the tkinter module in Python. While I am more comfortable in the back, I enjoy building something that doesn't require the console to work.
