# Python-based Calculator
Personal project started during winter break of 2020-2021

## Introduction
This project is a fully-functional, graphical, python-based calculator. It does everything a traditional calculator can do. One thing to note, I did not understand cross-platform programming when first making this project. With that being said, it works really nice on Windows x64 operating systems but can be a little weird on operating systems such as linux. It is a goal of mine to come back to this project, convert it to C++, and make it cross-platform.

## Why?
I was bored and got inspired by a video on Youtube of a develepor creating a web-based calculator.
**The code is written from scratch with no tutorials**

## Inspiration
As previously mentioned, I was inspired by a video on Youtube; however, that was not my only source of inspiration.
Recently, I discovered the tkinter module in Python. While I am more comfortable in the back, I enjoy building something that doesn't require the console to work.

## How it works
This section is under construction. I am screenshotting the code and preparing a nice, in-depth explanation of how this program works.
